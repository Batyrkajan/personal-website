Improvement Suggestions
1. Performance Optimizations
Digital Rain Effect: The digital rain effect is identical to the homepage's implementation. To avoid code duplication and improve maintainability, extract it into a reusable component or hook (e.g., DigitalRain). This also reduces the risk of inconsistencies if you update the effect later.
Intersection Observer: The IntersectionObserver is well-implemented for scroll animations, but it could be optimized by debouncing or throttling resize events if the container size changes, preventing excessive recalculations.
Image Loading: Using Next.js's Image component is great for optimization, but consider adding priority for above-the-fold images or loading="lazy" for others to improve initial page load time.
Card Refs Management: The cardsRefs state is an array of DOM elements, which could lead to memory leaks if not cleaned up properly. Consider using a Map or WeakMap for better ref management, especially if the project list grows dynamically.
2. Accessibility Enhancements
Keyboard Navigation: The project cards respond to onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave for hover effects, but there's no keyboard equivalent (e.g., onFocus and onBlur). Add keyboard support to ensure accessibility for users who navigate with keyboards.
ARIA Attributes: Add role="region" and aria-label to the project cards to describe their purpose for screen readers. For example, aria-label="Project: ${project.title}".
Image Alt Text: The alt text for project images is set to project.title, which is good. Consider making it more descriptive (e.g., alt="Screenshot of ${project.title} project") for better context.
Social Links: The social media links in the footer have good target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer", but add aria-label (e.g., aria-label="Visit Batyr's GitHub profile") for clarity.
3. User Experience Improvements
Interactive Feedback: The hover effect on project cards (glowing border and glitch overlay) is engaging. Consider adding a subtle click interaction (e.g., a modal or expanded view with more project details) to make the cards feel more interactive.
Project Filtering: With multiple projects, users might want to filter by technology (e.g., "Next.js" or "Python") or status (e.g., "Coming Soon"). A simple filter bar could enhance navigation.
Dynamic Links: The demoUrl and githubUrl are currently placeholders (#). Replace them with actual links or disable them (e.g., with pointer-events: none and a tooltip) for "Coming Soon" projects to avoid user confusion.
Mobile Layout: The md:grid-cols-2 layout is responsive, but on smaller screens, consider stacking cards with a slight stagger or animation to maintain the cyberpunk vibe.
4. Code Reusability and Maintainability
Reusable Components: The project card structure is repeated. Create a ProjectCard component to encapsulate the card's logic and styling, reducing duplication and making updates easier.
Centralized Data: Move the projects array to a separate file (e.g., data/projects.ts) for better organization and reusability across pages (e.g., a project preview on the homepage).
Consistent Styling: The social media links in the footer are styled differently from the homepage. Consider reusing the same hover-glow class or creating a SocialLink component for consistency.
Type Safety: Add TypeScript interfaces for the projects array and state types (e.g., activeProject: number | null) to catch errors early and improve IDE support.
5. SEO and Discoverability
Metadata: Add a Next.js Head component to include a page title (e.g., "Batyr's Projects"), description, and Open Graph tags for better SEO and social media sharing.
Structured Data: Use JSON-LD structured data for projects to improve search engine indexing (e.g., marking up each project as a CreativeWork).
6. Visual and Thematic Enhancements
Dynamic Animations: Add Framer Motion animations for card entrances (e.g., a slight rotation or scale effect) to enhance the cyberpunk aesthetic, especially since you already use Framer Motion for the "NEUROMORPHIC PORTFOLIO" project.
Status Badges: The "Coming Soon" badges are effective. Consider adding a "Completed" badge for finished projects (e.g., the portfolio itself) with a different color or style.
Theme Consistency: Ensure the glowing orb and digital rain match the homepage's styling exactly (e.g., same --neon-purple shade) to maintain visual cohesion.
Specific Code Enhancement: Reusable DigitalRain Component
To address code duplication and improve maintainability, here's a reusable DigitalRain component that encapsulates the digital rain effect used on both the homepage and projects page.
